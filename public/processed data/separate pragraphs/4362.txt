0. The carburetor heat control was found in the 'in' position but the engine had become detached during impact possibly moving the carburetor heat control as it separated from the firewall . One witness stated the engine sounded as if it was sputtering; another stated that it was noisy and loud for a small airplane . The pax noted their low altitude over the mountainous/hilly terrain and 'yelled' for the pilot to climb to avoid trees .
