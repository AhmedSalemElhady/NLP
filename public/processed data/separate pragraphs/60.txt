0. At about 400' MSL & 1 mile from the runway the flight deviated to the left & began a non-standard missed approach . Radar data showed the airplane flew a southerly course for about 2-1/2 miles then it began turning & radar contact was lost . Radar data showed that on final approach the airplane deviated laterally (S-turned) through the final approach course (as if the pilot was overcorrecting) .
