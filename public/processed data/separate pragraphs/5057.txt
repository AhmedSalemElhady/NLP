A hole in the top of the engine crankcase was also observed at this location which the examination report stated was 'probably caused by [the] brass plug being pushed out by [the] crank shaft lobe' . During the landing roll the aircraft's left wing struck a road sign that the pilot could not see causing the aircraft to leave the road .
