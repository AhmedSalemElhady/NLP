0. The flight departed Glendive; and approximately 4 hours later the pilot radioed Great Falls AFSS looking for a VFR airport available for landing . He was advised by the briefer that 'VFR flight was not recommended' due to a low pressure system in Montana along with obscurations . Both wings impacted terrain short of the fuselage ground impact site .
