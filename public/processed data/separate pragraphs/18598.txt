0. The left wing struck the runway the airplane veered to the left and departed the runway . The FO's date of hire was 1/9/96 and this was her first line trip with the airline . The right engine reached full power about '2 seconds' before the left engine and this occurrence was immediately followed by a 38 degree roll to the left and then a three-plus 'g' spike in the vertical acceleration when the wings became level again .
