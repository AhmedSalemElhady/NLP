The aft bearing (gear case cover) of the FCU/oil pump drive spur gear had disintegrated due to failure of the ribbon-type ball separator which was found in the bottom of the gearbox in two pieces and deformed . The ball separator was manufactured from an austenitic stainless steel instead of AISI 1010 as specified by the manufacturer and the material exceeded allowable hardness specifications .
