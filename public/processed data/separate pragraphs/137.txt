0. The pilot(s) acknowledged the clearance & initiated the approach . Radar data showed that on final approach the airplane deviated laterally (S-turned) through the final approach course (as if the pilot was overcorrecting) . At about 400' MSL & 1 mile from the runway the flight deviated to the left & began a non-standard missed approach .
