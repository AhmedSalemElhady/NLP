0. During cruise flight at 14000 feet mean sea level the engine failed . The air/oil separator hose to the scavenge pump was plugged about 10 inches along its length with a substance with a high lead content resulting in the recurring pilot report of excessive oil consumption . The flight was vectored to a nearby airport but the pilot flew toward another airport and crashed in a residential area .
