0. Neither the front seated pilot nor the rear seated certified flight instructor were injured . However when the pilot applied the toe brakes his left shoe (size 14) slipped off the pedal and became jammed next to the console . The private pilot had just purchased the airplane and was in the process of flying it to his Annapolis Maryland home with the aid of the CFI .
