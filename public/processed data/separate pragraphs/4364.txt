0. The pax noted their low altitude over the mountainous/hilly terrain and 'yelled' for the pilot to climb to avoid trees . The pax said the pilot did not respond but was leaning forward as if to be trying to read or reach something . The pax stated that after they flew by the cottage he did not hear an application of power to climb as expected .
