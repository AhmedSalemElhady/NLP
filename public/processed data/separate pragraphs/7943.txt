0. The helicopter sustained substantial damage; however the certificated flight instructor and his airplane-rated student were not injured . As the aircraft stopped he heard a loud sharp sound that was accompanied by sustained vibration and an uncommanded right yaw of about 30 degrees . He shut down the engine by pulling the fuel valve and mixture control into the "off" position .
