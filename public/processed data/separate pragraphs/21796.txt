0. Since purchasing the aircraft he had logged 25 hours of transition/checkout in the airplane and had flown it for a total of about 22 hours mostly on 'sight seeing flights' . The aircraft's nose dropped in the right turn and the aircraft crashed nose first on a taxiway . At the time the aircraft was purchased by the pilot in March 1996 he had not flown for about 10 years .
