0. Radar data showed that on final approach the airplane deviated laterally (S-turned) through the final approach course (as if the pilot was overcorrecting) . At about 400' MSL & 1 mile from the runway the flight deviated to the left & began a non-standard missed approach . Engine rpm was heard to increase then the plane crashed in a boat docking area .
