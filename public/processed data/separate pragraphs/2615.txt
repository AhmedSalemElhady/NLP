Safety Board examination of the only two recovered 2nd-stage nozzle locks from the accident engine along with a section of casing with a nozzle lock stud attached revealed intergranular fracture features degradation at the surface of the fracture features and grain boundaries typical of oxidation damage . The intergranular fractures and oxidation damage found at the grain boundaries were consistent with stress rupture .
