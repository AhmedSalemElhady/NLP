0. The flight originated from Selma Alabama a few minutes before the accident . As he approached the airport he realized he would not make it to the runway and turned toward a road for a landing . He initiated a turn back to Selma and in the turn the engine lost power dropping to about 1200 rpm and he noticed oil on the windshield .
