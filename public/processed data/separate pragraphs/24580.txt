0. The airplane impacted a small hill about 5 miles north of the airport on a magnetic heading of 080 degrees . Soon thereafter the tower controller advised the pilot that radar showed he had deviated from the localizer course & inquired about his intentions . He was advised that runway RVR was 4000 feet (about 3/4 mile visibility) but was not provided other current weather or airport information .
