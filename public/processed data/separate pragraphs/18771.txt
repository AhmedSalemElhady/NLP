0. On November 21 2001 at 1126 hours Pacific standard time an Aero Commander 500S N900RA collided with mountainous terrain on Eagle Peak near Eagleville California . The personal cross-country flight departed Reno Nevada about 1045 en route to Wenatchee Washington . The sector controller informed the pilot that he was unable to clear the flight to that altitude because the Minimum En route Altitude (MEA) for the route segment was 14000 feet .
