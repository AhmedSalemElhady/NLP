0. The pilot attempted to turn back toward the field but the aircraft 'lost lift' and impacted the ground . The pilot did not seek or receive the aircraft owner's permission for this flight and did not determine that the aircraft was out of annual or that it incorporated an as-yet unapproved fuel tank installation . The fuel tank installation had not yet received FAA approval since the non-standard tank was failing tank drain tests (introducing the potential for the tank drain port to become unported at 'extreme flight attitudes') .
