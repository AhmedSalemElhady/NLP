0. Neither pilot reported how fuel quantity was verified or how much fuel they had on board before departure . The engine was examined by a licensed airframe and powerplant mechanic who found no discrepancies . The second pilot reported to the mechanic/owner that they 'were flying at about 110 MPH they were not at altitude and they did little leaning' .
