0. An AIRMET was issued for light occasional moderate rime and mixed icing in clouds and precipitation below 22000 feet along the pilot's route of flight . On approach as the airplane descended through a cloud layer about 500 feet from the ground the ice began to shed from the airplane . Due to ice remaining on the windshield the pilot had difficulty judging the distance to the runway and had to look through the side window of the airplane to maintain visual reference with the ground .
