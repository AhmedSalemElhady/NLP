0. As the airplane veered off the runway and control was lost the right landing gear axle broke and the right wing impacted the ground . The instructor stated that he yelled at the pilot to release the brake but to no avail . However when the pilot applied the toe brakes his left shoe (size 14) slipped off the pedal and became jammed next to the console .
