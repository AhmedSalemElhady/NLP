0. He made a steep turn to the left back toward the airport then a right turn toward the runway . Since purchasing the aircraft he had logged 25 hours of transition/checkout in the airplane and had flown it for a total of about 22 hours mostly on 'sight seeing flights' . The right propeller had damage consistent with the engine operating .
