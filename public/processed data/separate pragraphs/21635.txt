0. The crew lost elevator trim after leveling at flight level (FL) 310 and they had to hold continuous control pressure to maintain level flight . Postflight inspections of the elevator trim actuators by FAA inspectors revealed paint overspray on the elevator trim actuator push rods scoring and corrosion on the push rods and white desiccant windows on the actuators . Normal elevator trim operation was regained as the aircraft descended through 16000 feet on its approach (total air temperature -7 degrees C); the flight subsequently landed without further incident .
