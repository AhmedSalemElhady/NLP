0. The pilot applied right aileron and rudder then he visually checked the ailerons and observed that both were in the up position . He moved the control stick forward to increase airspeed and the shutter continued . The pilot stated he was at an altitude of about 150 to 200 feet when he made an aileron input which was hard enough to cause fluid in the hopper tank to 'slosh' around .
