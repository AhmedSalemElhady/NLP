0. On December 6 2001 approximately 1500 mountain standard time a Cessna 310 N5043J impacted a fence during an aborted takeoff at Sidney-Richland Municipal Airport Sidney Montana . There was no report of an ELT activation . He therefore reduced the left engine to idle but the aircraft departed the right side of the runway .
