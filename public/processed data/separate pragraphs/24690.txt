0. The airplane impacted a small hill about 5 miles north of the airport on a magnetic heading of 080 degrees . Soon thereafter the tower controller advised the pilot that radar showed he had deviated from the localizer course & inquired about his intentions . In preparation for the ILS he was instructed to descend & maintain 9000 feet then to reduce his speed 20 knots as he was closing on an MD-80 3 miles ahead .
