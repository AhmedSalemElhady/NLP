0. The pilot of the Piper had logged 20 hrs of formation flying time . There was evidence that when the midair occurred the Piper was below & to the left of the Cessna . When he 1st saw them the airplanes appeared to be side by side at the same altitude with the left airplane in a slight bank & the right airplane in a right bank .
