The right engine reached full power about '2 seconds' before the left engine and this occurrence was immediately followed by a 38 degree roll to the left and then a three-plus 'g' spike in the vertical acceleration when the wings became level again . The Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR) Study showed that while on approach the airplane rolled approximately 20 degrees to the right .
