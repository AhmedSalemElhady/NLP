0. About 150 feet agl and 60 knots as the helicopter was accelerating the pilot heard a loud 'bang' and the low rotor rpm and engine out audio warning activated . A main rotor blade contacted the tailboom partially separating it aft of the horizontal stabilizer . The passenger further reported that the landing attitude was 'relatively normal;' however 'it was possibly a little more pitched up than normal' .
