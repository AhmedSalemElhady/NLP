0. Allison CEB 1228 issued November 20 1985 calls for bearings with the ribbon-type pressed steel separator to be replaced with bearings that incorporate a one-piece machined steel separator . The mechanic reported that he had replaced the number 25 bearing and the spur adapter gear shaft 265 hours and 4 months before the accident which would have provided access to the gearbox to accomplish the bulletin . The ball separator was manufactured from an austenitic stainless steel instead of AISI 1010 as specified by the manufacturer and the material exceeded allowable hardness specifications .
