0. Allison CEB 1228 issued November 20 1985 calls for bearings with the ribbon-type pressed steel separator to be replaced with bearings that incorporate a one-piece machined steel separator . The mechanic reported that he had replaced the number 25 bearing and the spur adapter gear shaft 265 hours and 4 months before the accident which would have provided access to the gearbox to accomplish the bulletin . The balls were ejected into the gear case and one was ingested by the oil pump which caused internal jamming and the resultant shearing of the splined adapter which drives the oil pump .
