0. Examination of the left and right engine did not reveal any condition that would have caused an operational problem . When queried after takeoff the pilot informed ATC that the left engine was not developing full power and that he was having difficulty in maintaining altitude . A review of pilot log sheets showed that the pilot had prevously flown the Piper PA-34 between 1/13/86 and 10/6/91; since that period he had only flown it once which was on the day before the accident .
