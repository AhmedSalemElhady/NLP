On October 25 2001 at 1940 central daylight time a Cessna 152 single-engine airplane N67797 was substantially damaged when it impacted a fence during a forced landing following a loss of engine power while in cruise flight near Bethany Oklahoma . The pilot could not maintain altitude to make it to the airport and therefore elected to land in a field .
