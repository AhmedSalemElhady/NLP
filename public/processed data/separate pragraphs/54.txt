0. At about 400' MSL & 1 mile from the runway the flight deviated to the left & began a non-standard missed approach . The left seat pilot had been issued a private pilot certificate based on his German certificate; he held an instrument rating but did not have a current medical certificate; no record was found of his previous flight time . The right seat pilot held a commercial & ATP certificate (with instrument rating) & was presumed to be the PIC; a review of his log book revealed the last recorded flight in this make & model of airplane was on 3/27/88 .
