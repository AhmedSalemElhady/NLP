0. This occurred as the noninstrument-rated private pilot was returning home on a night VFR flight over hilly and sparsely populated terrain . The pilot's instructor stated that the pilot knew the area well and that he was aware of the rising terrain . The flight instructor believed the pilot felt pressured to get home that evening because he had a nine o'clock appointment the next morning in Austin to inspect a property that he had sold .
