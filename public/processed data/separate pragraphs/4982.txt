0. FAA inspectors who examined the airplane after the accident reported they found fuel aboard and no evidence of any mechanical problems with the engine . The fuel tank installation had not yet received FAA approval since the non-standard tank was failing tank drain tests (introducing the potential for the tank drain port to become unported at 'extreme flight attitudes') . The pilot switched fuel tanks but the engine 'did not revive in time' .
