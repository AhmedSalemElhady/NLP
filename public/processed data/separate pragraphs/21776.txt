0. The airplane came to rest on the right side of the runway about 250 feet from the point of initial impact . An FAA inspector at the airport at the time saw the airplane on the runway with the 'nose wheel collapsed' . I feel that it required extremely hard ground contact to cause the amount of damage that the aircraft sustained .
