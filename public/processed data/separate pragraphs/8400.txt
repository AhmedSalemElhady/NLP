0. On October 26 2000 about 1105 hours Pacific daylight time a Grumman American AA-5A N26470 was destroyed when it made an off airport forced landing in Gardena California . The airplane severed a high power electrical cable then came to rest behind an automotive repair facility and caught fire . Rescuers used fire extinguishers and a water hose to control the flames and prevent further injury to the pilot while they pulled him from the burning wreckage .
