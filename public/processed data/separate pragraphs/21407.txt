The airplane's right wing struck a 25-foot-high pole at the edge of an open field about 12 feet above the ground and 900 feet from the approach end on the runway . The private pilot stated that during the approach he thought that they were getting 'too slow and too low' and when full power was applied the engine response 'sounded strange' .
