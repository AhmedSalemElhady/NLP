On May 30 2001 about 1155 Alaska daylight time a float-equipped de Havilland DHC-2 airplane N150PL sustained substantial damage during a landing on Alexander Creek about 15 miles north-northeast of Alexander Alaska . After departure from Lake Hood the student did some aerial maneuvering and then proceeded to land on Alexander Creek . The airplane suddenly veered to the right and the floats collided with the creek bank .
