0. On March 7 2000 at 1020 hours Pacific standard time a Bell 47G-4A N1354X made an uncommanded hard landing after takeoff from Wasco California . In this event the main rotor clutch slipped during takeoff resulting in a momentary droop in main rotor rpm and an uncommanded hard landing . The pilot reported to Federal Aviation Administration inspectors that he had filled his hopper and was departing for a spray run when the main rotor rpm unexpectedly drooped .
