0. The airline transport pilot who was the sole occupant was not injured but the aircraft which is owned and operated by Exec Air of Helena Montana sustained substantial damage . He therefore reduced the left engine to idle but the aircraft departed the right side of the runway . Soon thereafter the aircraft collided with the chain link fence and came to a stop about 200 feet past the fence line .
