0. Radar data showed that on final approach the airplane deviated laterally (S-turned) through the final approach course (as if the pilot was overcorrecting) . The pilot(s) acknowledged the clearance & initiated the approach . Radar data showed the airplane flew a southerly course for about 2-1/2 miles then it began turning & radar contact was lost .
