0. After washing the airplane the pilot took off for a short night flight to dry it . The airplane collided with trees and hilly terrain and the extensively fragmented wreckage was spread over a 100- by 200-foot debris field . Another witness located closer to the impact location heard loud sustained engine sounds 'like a kamikaze in a dive' .
