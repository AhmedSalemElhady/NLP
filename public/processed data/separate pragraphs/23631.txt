0. The flight departed Glendive; and approximately 4 hours later the pilot radioed Great Falls AFSS looking for a VFR airport available for landing . He was advised by the briefer that 'VFR flight was not recommended' due to a low pressure system in Montana along with obscurations . Both wing struts separated at the strut-to-fuselage attach points and the right wing was found in two separate pieces just short of the intact left wing .
