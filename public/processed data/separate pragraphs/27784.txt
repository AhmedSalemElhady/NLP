0. While making a forced landing in an open field the pilot reduced power and the left wing dropped and collided with the ground . The pilot stated he was at an altitude of about 150 to 200 feet when he made an aileron input which was hard enough to cause fluid in the hopper tank to 'slosh' around . He moved the control stick forward to increase airspeed and the shutter continued .
