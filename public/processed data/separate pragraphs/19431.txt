0. The aircraft was on a company VFR flight plan . Any errors in this report will be corrected when the final report has been completed . Reportedly when he saw that there was a fence ahead the pilot pushed the left throttle back to the full-power position so that he would have enough speed to lift the nose of the aircraft off the ground resulting in the aircraft impacting the fence in a nose-high attitude .
