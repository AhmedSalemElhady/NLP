0. The foreman that managed the ranch where the airplane intended to land witnessed the accident . He added that the airplane overshot the extended centerline for the runway and the airplane was banked into a left turn as it appeared to be attempting to get re-established on the final approach course . The round-robin flight was scheduled to transport personnel and cargo to 3 intermediate airstrips (Nuevamente Cashaschanes and Sumacal) servicing ranches also owned and operated by the owner of the airplane .
