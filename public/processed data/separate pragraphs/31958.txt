0. A witness observed the airplane twice descend 'at a rapid rate of speed' then make 'a steep ascent back into the air' . The light east-northeast wind increased in velocity as he turned causing the airplane to 'sink' and turn left . The witness 'did not see at any time the plane's wings dip as if it were fighting winds' .
