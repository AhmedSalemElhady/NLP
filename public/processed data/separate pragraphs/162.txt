0. Radar data showed the airplane flew a southerly course for about 2-1/2 miles then it began turning & radar contact was lost . Witnesses saw the airplane descending through fog in a steep nose down right bank attitude before disappearing from view . At about 400' MSL & 1 mile from the runway the flight deviated to the left & began a non-standard missed approach .
