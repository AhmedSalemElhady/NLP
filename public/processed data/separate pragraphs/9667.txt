0. The helicopter was approximately 100 feet agl when the instructor pilot took over control of the helicopter and attempted a 'high power recovery' . While en route at 1000 feet agl the instructor pilot gave the student a simulated engine failure over a field and instructed the student to make an autorotation with a power recovery . At that time the instructor applied left pedal and heard the low rotor RPM warning horn .
