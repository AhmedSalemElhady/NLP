The pilot elected to make a precautionary landing at the Harvey Young Airport; however engine rpm decreased to where altitude could not be maintained and the pilot initiated a forced landing to a bean field about one mile northeast of the airport . The right wing spar outboard of the lift strut was fractured and the vertical stabilizer was damaged .
