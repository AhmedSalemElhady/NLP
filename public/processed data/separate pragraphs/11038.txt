0. The private pilot had just purchased the airplane and was in the process of flying it to his Annapolis Maryland home with the aid of the CFI . The instructor stated that he yelled at the pilot to release the brake but to no avail . However when the pilot applied the toe brakes his left shoe (size 14) slipped off the pedal and became jammed next to the console .
