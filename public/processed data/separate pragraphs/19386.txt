0. The airline transport pilot who was the sole occupant was not injured but the aircraft which is owned and operated by Exec Air of Helena Montana sustained substantial damage . Reportedly when he saw that there was a fence ahead the pilot pushed the left throttle back to the full-power position so that he would have enough speed to lift the nose of the aircraft off the ground resulting in the aircraft impacting the fence in a nose-high attitude . The aircraft was on a company VFR flight plan .
