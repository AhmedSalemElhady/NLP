0. With a fight instructor the pilot executed a normal takeoff from Runway 34 for right closed traffic . After a short delay the UH-60 air-taxied to the ramp . When the accident airplane was about 20 feet above the ground it suddenly rolled right (faster than a full application of aileron could counteract) and the right wing contacted the ground .
