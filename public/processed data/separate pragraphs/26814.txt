0. There was no odor of fuel in the area . The pilot said he did not visually check the fuel but 'stuck his finger in the fuel tank and felt fuel' (in his accident report however he said he visually inspected the fuel) . When the airplane was placed upright he found no evidence of fuel in the fuel tanks fuel stains on the ground or fuel dye stains on the wings .
