0. Another witness located closer to the impact location heard loud sustained engine sounds 'like a kamikaze in a dive' . The airplane collided with trees and hilly terrain and the extensively fragmented wreckage was spread over a 100- by 200-foot debris field . The aircraft sounds terminated after a few seconds with the sound of '2 cars hitting each other' .
