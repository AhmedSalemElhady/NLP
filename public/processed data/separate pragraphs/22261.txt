0. The Cessna 210 was cruising at 11000 ft at night when the engine began to run rough & lose power . During the landing two vehicles were struck . The #5 exhaust valve was fractured between the valve head & stem; but the cause of this fracture could not be determine due to impact damage to the fractured surfaces .
