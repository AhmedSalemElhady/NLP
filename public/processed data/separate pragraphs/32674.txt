0. On approach as the airplane descended through a cloud layer about 500 feet from the ground the ice began to shed from the airplane . Unable to maintain VFR the pilot obtained an IFR clearance and was told to climb to 2000 then to 4000 feet . Due to ice remaining on the windshield the pilot had difficulty judging the distance to the runway and had to look through the side window of the airplane to maintain visual reference with the ground .
