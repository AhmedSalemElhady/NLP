0. While en route at 1000 feet agl the instructor pilot gave the student a simulated engine failure over a field and instructed the student to make an autorotation with a power recovery . The instructor stated that he thought that the helicopter did not touch down level due to the rotation to the right . The instructor made one last search for obstacles and looked back into the cockpit to find the airspeed was at 45 knots and the main rotor RPM was at the bottom of the green arc (approximately 97%) .
