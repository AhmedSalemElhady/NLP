0. Radar data showed the airplane flew a southerly course for about 2-1/2 miles then it began turning & radar contact was lost . At about 400' MSL & 1 mile from the runway the flight deviated to the left & began a non-standard missed approach . Engine rpm was heard to increase then the plane crashed in a boat docking area .
