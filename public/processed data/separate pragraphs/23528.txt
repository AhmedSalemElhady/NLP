0. There was evidence that when the midair occurred the Piper was below & to the left of the Cessna . When he 1st saw them the airplanes appeared to be side by side at the same altitude with the left airplane in a slight bank & the right airplane in a right bank . Cessna 305E N305JH had been airborne about 11 minutes & Piper J3C-65 N804DA had been airborne about 2 minutes when a collision of the 2 airplanes occurred .
