The PA-30's right engine stopped upon wing contact and the momentum carried both aircraft in a clockwise arc a short distance southeast . At a point consistent with the PA-30's initial contact with the Cessna a pool of blood identified the spot were the pilot was first struck by the PA-30's left propeller .
