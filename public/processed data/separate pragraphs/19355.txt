0. On December 6 2001 approximately 1500 mountain standard time a Cessna 310 N5043J impacted a fence during an aborted takeoff at Sidney-Richland Municipal Airport Sidney Montana . There was no report of an ELT activation . Reportedly when he saw that there was a fence ahead the pilot pushed the left throttle back to the full-power position so that he would have enough speed to lift the nose of the aircraft off the ground resulting in the aircraft impacting the fence in a nose-high attitude .
