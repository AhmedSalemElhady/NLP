0. On May 16 2001 at 1939 central daylight time a Kirchner Pietenpol Aircamper home built airplane N25157 was substantially damaged during a forced landing following a loss of engine power near Tulsa Oklahoma . The pilot elected to make a precautionary landing at the Harvey Young Airport; however engine rpm decreased to where altitude could not be maintained and the pilot initiated a forced landing to a bean field about one mile northeast of the airport . Examination of the airplane by FAA inspectors who responded to the accident site revealed that the landing gear had collapsed and partially separated .
