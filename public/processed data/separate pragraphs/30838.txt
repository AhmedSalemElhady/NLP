0. The only ground reference lights were from the city which was located north and west of the accident site . The aircraft sounds terminated after a few seconds with the sound of '2 cars hitting each other' . Another witness located closer to the impact location heard loud sustained engine sounds 'like a kamikaze in a dive' .
