According to witnesses working several miles east of the accident site they heard an airplane flying overhead traveling east to west and low to the ground; however low cloud cover snow and poor visibility prevented them from viewing the aircraft . The airplane was found along a 45 degree inclining slope at an elevation of 12808 feet mean sea level on a glacier along the north face of Arapaho Peak on the east side of the Continental Divide . A search was initiated and the aircraft was located at 1430 the following afternoon .
