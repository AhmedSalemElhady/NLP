A witness observed the airplane in a high flare above the runway threshold watched it drop vertically landing hard on the main landing gear bounce and bank to the left . The right engine reached full power about '2 seconds' before the left engine and this occurrence was immediately followed by a 38 degree roll to the left and then a three-plus 'g' spike in the vertical acceleration when the wings became level again .
