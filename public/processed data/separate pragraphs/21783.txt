0. The aircraft's nose dropped in the right turn and the aircraft crashed nose first on a taxiway . Since purchasing the aircraft he had logged 25 hours of transition/checkout in the airplane and had flown it for a total of about 22 hours mostly on 'sight seeing flights' . The right propeller had damage consistent with the engine operating .
