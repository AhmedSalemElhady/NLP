0. The upper surface of the left wing of the Piper collided with the left side of the Cessna's empennage just forward of the left horizontal stabilizer . The pilot of the Piper had logged 20 hrs of formation flying time . When he 1st saw them the airplanes appeared to be side by side at the same altitude with the left airplane in a slight bank & the right airplane in a right bank .
