0. The pilot applied right aileron and rudder then he visually checked the ailerons and observed that both were in the up position . The pilot stated he was at an altitude of about 150 to 200 feet when he made an aileron input which was hard enough to cause fluid in the hopper tank to 'slosh' around . While making a forced landing in an open field the pilot reduced power and the left wing dropped and collided with the ground .
