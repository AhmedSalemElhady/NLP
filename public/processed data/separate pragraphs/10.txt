0. At about 400' MSL & 1 mile from the runway the flight deviated to the left & began a non-standard missed approach . Radar data showed that on final approach the airplane deviated laterally (S-turned) through the final approach course (as if the pilot was overcorrecting) . The left seat pilot had been issued a private pilot certificate based on his German certificate; he held an instrument rating but did not have a current medical certificate; no record was found of his previous flight time .
