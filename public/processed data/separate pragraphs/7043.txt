0. While in cruise flight about 1200 feet msl in the area of a small saddle between two low hills the airplane began to lose altitude in a strong downdraft . The airplane continued toward the ground and the pilot said he lowered the nose of the airplane into an area of tall alders to make contact with terrain with some degree of control . He observed trees below him that were being flattened by the downdraft .
