0. On March 7 2000 at 1020 hours Pacific standard time a Bell 47G-4A N1354X made an uncommanded hard landing after takeoff from Wasco California . The rotor rpm was in the process of increasing but before the pilot was able to arrest the sink rate the aircraft landed hard on the right skid . In this event the main rotor clutch slipped during takeoff resulting in a momentary droop in main rotor rpm and an uncommanded hard landing .
