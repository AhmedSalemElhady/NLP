0. The pilot said that although he had flown other Cessna single engine airplanes this was his first experience flying the Cessna 207 . This would give the airplane a range of 695 miles and an endurance of between 53 and 56 hours . The pilot said he did not visually check the fuel but 'stuck his finger in the fuel tank and felt fuel' (in his accident report however he said he visually inspected the fuel) .
