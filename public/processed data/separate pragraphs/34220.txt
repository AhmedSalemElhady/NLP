The mechanic reported that he had replaced the number 25 bearing and the spur adapter gear shaft 265 hours and 4 months before the accident which would have provided access to the gearbox to accomplish the bulletin . The aft bearing (gear case cover) of the FCU/oil pump drive spur gear had disintegrated due to failure of the ribbon-type ball separator which was found in the bottom of the gearbox in two pieces and deformed . The ball separator was manufactured from an austenitic stainless steel instead of AISI 1010 as specified by the manufacturer and the material exceeded allowable hardness specifications .
