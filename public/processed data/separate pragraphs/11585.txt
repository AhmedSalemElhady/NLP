0. The flight was originating at the time of the accident . A witness on the golf course stated he did not see any smoke coming from the airplane as it flew over his head and he stated the engine sounded like it was operating at full power just before the impact with the trees . It the turned to the left in a steep bank angle and leveled the wings on a southerly heading .
