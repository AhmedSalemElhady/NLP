0. At about 400' MSL & 1 mile from the runway the flight deviated to the left & began a non-standard missed approach . Radio transmissions from the airplane became unreadable as the approach was continued . The left seat pilot had been issued a private pilot certificate based on his German certificate; he held an instrument rating but did not have a current medical certificate; no record was found of his previous flight time .
