0. The helicopter was approximately 100 feet agl when the instructor pilot took over control of the helicopter and attempted a 'high power recovery' . The instructor stated that he thought that the helicopter did not touch down level due to the rotation to the right . The helicopter touched down in the field 'hopped to the right approximately 40 degrees' and then became airborne again .
