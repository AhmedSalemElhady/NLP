0. When the airplane was approximately 18 miles west of Grand Junction the engine lost power forcing the pilot to land in an onion field . The pilot said he did not visually check the fuel but 'stuck his finger in the fuel tank and felt fuel' (in his accident report however he said he visually inspected the fuel) . The pilot said that although he had flown other Cessna single engine airplanes this was his first experience flying the Cessna 207 .
