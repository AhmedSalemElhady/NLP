0. An alternate IFR missed approach procedure was issued & the pilot(s) acknowledged by clicking the mike button; however the alternate missed approach instruction was not followed . The right seat pilot held a commercial & ATP certificate (with instrument rating) & was presumed to be the PIC; a review of his log book revealed the last recorded flight in this make & model of airplane was on 3/27/88 . Radar data showed that on final approach the airplane deviated laterally (S-turned) through the final approach course (as if the pilot was overcorrecting) .
