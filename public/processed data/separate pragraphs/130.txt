0. At about 400' MSL & 1 mile from the runway the flight deviated to the left & began a non-standard missed approach . Radar data showed that on final approach the airplane deviated laterally (S-turned) through the final approach course (as if the pilot was overcorrecting) . An alternate IFR missed approach procedure was issued & the pilot(s) acknowledged by clicking the mike button; however the alternate missed approach instruction was not followed .
