0. A post-accident examination of the aircraft's engine revealed damage to the number 1 piston with the wrist pin brass plug missing . A hole in the top of the engine crankcase was also observed at this location which the examination report stated was 'probably caused by [the] brass plug being pushed out by [the] crank shaft lobe' . The pilot was able to restart the engine but oil then started coming from under the cowling .
