0. One witness stated that he watched the helicopter fly until out of site then heard a "pop sound" he said it sounded unusual and was not very loud . Examination of the wreckage found it localized in a heavily wooded area with the skids buried in the ground with the trailing ends protruding upward at about a 70-degree angle . They said the sky was clear of clouds and that the helicopter was low maybe 400 to 500 feet above the ground .
