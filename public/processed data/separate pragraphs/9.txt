0. During IFR arrival the flight was cleared for an ILS Runway 32 Approach . At about 400' MSL & 1 mile from the runway the flight deviated to the left & began a non-standard missed approach . Radar data showed that on final approach the airplane deviated laterally (S-turned) through the final approach course (as if the pilot was overcorrecting) .
