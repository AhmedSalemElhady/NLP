0. The helicopter touched down in the field 'hopped to the right approximately 40 degrees' and then became airborne again . At that time the instructor applied left pedal and heard the low rotor RPM warning horn . As the helicopter became airborne it rotated 360 degrees to the right contacted the ground with the tail rotor then the right skid .
