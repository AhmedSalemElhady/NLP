0. The Cessna 210 was cruising at 11000 ft at night when the engine began to run rough & lose power . The #5 intake valve was also partially broken but fracture of this valve appeared to have been from overload due to impact with debris inside the cylinder . Further examination revealed the #5 exhaust valve guide had fractured just below the flange that seated the guide into the cylinder head with evidence of fatigue .
