0. Post-crash examination revealed that the long line had pulled aft and left from its vertical reference into the airframe structure (the 7:30 position of the hell hole in the belly of the helicopter) resulting in 1) the separation of one of the #1 engine push/pull rods and 2) the deformation of engine control rods associated with the #1 engine flight idle stop (solenoid) which then sheared . Immediately thereafter the PIC noted a loss of power in the #1 engine . The shearing of the flight idle stop resulted in a restriction/cessation of fuel flow to the #1 engine fuel control unit and subsequent engine shutdown .
