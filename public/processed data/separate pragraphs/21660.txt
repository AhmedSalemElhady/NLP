Inspection of the runway surface showed that an initial heavy nose wheel strike occurred in the center of runways 15 and 21 followed by one prop strike indentation in the runway about 15 feet later and then skid marks indicating that the nose wheel had collapsed and was sliding sideways' . An FAA inspector at the airport at the time saw the airplane on the runway with the 'nose wheel collapsed' .
