0. The private pilot had just purchased the airplane and was in the process of flying it to his Annapolis Maryland home with the aid of the CFI . As the airplane veered off the runway and control was lost the right landing gear axle broke and the right wing impacted the ground . The instructor stated that he yelled at the pilot to release the brake but to no avail .
