0. Allison CEB 1228 issued November 20 1985 calls for bearings with the ribbon-type pressed steel separator to be replaced with bearings that incorporate a one-piece machined steel separator . The balls were ejected into the gear case and one was ingested by the oil pump which caused internal jamming and the resultant shearing of the splined adapter which drives the oil pump . The ball separator was manufactured from an austenitic stainless steel instead of AISI 1010 as specified by the manufacturer and the material exceeded allowable hardness specifications .
