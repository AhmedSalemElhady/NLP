The pilot experienced a partial loss of engine power while established in an out of ground effect hover at 150 feet agl and landed hard in the resulting autorotation . The balls were ejected into the gear case and one was ingested by the oil pump which caused internal jamming and the resultant shearing of the splined adapter which drives the oil pump .
